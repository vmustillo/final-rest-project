# final project REST service app

## IMPORTANT NOTE, do not commit your project ahead of time. Commit only on date and time, that ilker will email.

## Dependencies (as described in ex9)
+ make sure mongodb is intalled and command utilities "mongod" and "mongo" are available on git bash command line
+ make /c/data/db directory, the default directory where mongodb writes its files, is there
+ before starting the app, make sure to start mongodb in a separate git bash and leave that alone running

## Directions
+ Create project named final_project_rest
+ Create below directory structures in it
```
src/rest/controller
src/rest/model
src/rest/route

test/rest/controller
```
+ have mongoose model, teacherModel.js, under model dir
+ have rest controller, teacherRestController.js, under controller dir
+ have rest router, teacherRestRouter.js, under route dir
+ have the main JS of rest service app, main_restServer.js, directly under src dir
+ have test suite (Spec), teacherRestControllerSpec.js, under test/rest/controller dir

## like ex9, support below REST end points
+ let app run on port 9016
+ GET echo message service
```
http://localhost:9016/api/v1/teachers/echo/:msg
```
+ GET service to get all teachers from mongodb
```
http://localhost:9016/api/v1/teachers
```
+ GET service to get a specific teacher, whose _id (the attribute auto generated by mongodb and used as primary key) is provided in url (as request param id)
```
http://localhost:9016/api/v1/teachers/:id
```
+ POST service to create(save, add) a teacher, whose attribute values are provided in body, that supports json input
```
http://localhost:9016/api/v1/teachers
```
+ PUT service to update fully a specific teacher, whose _id value is provided in url
```
http://localhost:9016/api/v1/teachers/:id
```
+ PATCH service to update a specific teacher, whose _id value is provided in url, with whatever attributes are provided in the body of request
```
http://localhost:9016/api/v1/teachers/:id
```
+ DELETE service to delete a specific teacher, whose _id value is provided in url, with whatever attributes are provided in the body of request
```
http://localhost:9016/api/v1/teachers/:id
```

## similar to ex9, let this app whitelist angular app running at default angular port of 4200 on the localhost, for CORS

## similar to ex9, let same router support 2 base urls
+ let same router used for "/api/v1/teachers" base url, also support '/fdu/api/v1/teachers' base url

## submission details
+ Create at least 5 teacher entries to mongodb via this app
+ Test the service via curl or postman, capture screen shots of each of above REST services and send these screen captures along with github link upon submission
+ Also screen capture contents of mongodb via mongo shell client. Also send this in the email
+ Create a github repo final_project_rest and commit it on the day and time that will be emailed by ilker
